# WordLadder

This program takes a starting word and an ending word and figures out if there is a way to go from the start to the end only changing one letter each time. If it is possible it will print the shortest possible path to get there.
The program uses an input dictionary, graph theory, and breadth first search.

Sample Input and Output:
```
Enter the start word: lose
Enter the end word: beat
Yay! A word ladder is possible.
lose
lost
lest
best
beat
```
